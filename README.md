# Sokoban
This is a clone of the box pushing game sokoban.

## Controls
* Move : Arrow keys

## Browser
Build for Firefox but it works in Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. But there will be some design errors  in them.

## TODO
*Make it work in IE and Chrome. Change and build more sound effects.
* More levels.

## Ideas
* Have some holes in the floor where you can lost boxes. Complement with several floors in one level 
* with elevators between the floors.

## Credits
The levels are taken from the game gsoko that is part of the Ubuntu repositories. 
The first level is my own test level and is very easy.

## Instructions
Just download the repo and open sokoban.html in a browser.
